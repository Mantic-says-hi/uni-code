 TESTING WAS DONE BY COMPARING 
 EACH OF THE OUTPUTS BETWEEN 
 EACHOTHER. ALL OF THEM DISPLAY
 DIFFERENT FILES FOUND :
 RUBY : 2694
 BASH : 2695
 PERL : 2689
 I AM AT A LOSS TO TRY AND
 GET THEM OUTPUTTING THE EXACT
 SAME FILES. HOWEVER WITH THIS 
 TESTING I WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY
 THAT RUBY NEEDED THE
 "FILE::FNM_DOTMATCH" SPECIFIED
 IN THE SEARCH SINCE IT WAS MISSING
 ALL OF THE FOLDERS THAT STARTED
 WITH A FULLSTOP. THEY OUTPUT A LARGE
 MAJORITY OF THE FILES SO I AM HAPPY
 WITH THAT.
